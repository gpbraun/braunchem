- [ ] $\ce{Na} < \ce{Mg} < \ce{Al} < \ce{Si} < \ce{P} < \ce{S} < \ce{Cl} < \ce{Ar}$
- [x] $\ce{Na} < \ce{Al} < \ce{Mg} < \ce{Si} < \ce{S} < \ce{P} < \ce{Cl} < \ce{Ar}$
- [ ] $\ce{Mg} < \ce{Na} < \ce{Al} < \ce{P} < \ce{Si} < \ce{S} < \ce{Cl} < \ce{Ar}$
- [ ] $\ce{Na} < \ce{Mg} < \ce{Si} < \ce{Al} < \ce{P} < \ce{Cl} < \ce{S} < \ce{Ar}$
- [ ] $\ce{Na} < \ce{Al} < \ce{Mg} < \ce{Si} < \ce{P} < \ce{Cl} < \ce{S} < \ce{Ar}$
